<h1>Prototype for AirGuider - ATC-to-airplanes visual aid software.</h1>

*Designed for the ACRP's University Design Competition.*

In our interview with the retired pilot, we identified a problem in communications between the ATC operators and pilots due to the high-pressure nature of the situation and possible difficulties understanding different accents of the language.

This project takes on this challenge by presenting a distributed system for ATC-airplane system.
The main idea is for ATC to advertise its presence, playing a role of a "Peripheral" device. Airplanes serve as "Central" devices, and are able to request a connection to the ATC tower to start the communication.

For our prototype we used 2 iOS devices, leveraging Core Bluetooth stack for wireless communication.

Video Demo (using an old video to show multi-device support; had to mask device ids with boxes):
